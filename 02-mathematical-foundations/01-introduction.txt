Mathematical Concepts:

Before jumping in, why do we require mathematical concepts?
 - The mathematical concepts will help in number theory, optimization, and bitwise manipulations, which are useful in many algorithms.

1. Factorial Calculation (Recursive vs Iterative)

Formula
N = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * .... * 1

Example:
5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120

Can be solved in two ways:
1. Iterative approach
2. Recursive

Both the complexity O(n)

Iterative:

long FactorialIterative(int n) {
    long fact = 1;
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        fact *= i;
    }
    return fact;
}

Recursive:

long FactorialRecursive(int n) {
    if (n == 0 || n == 1) return 1;
    return n * FactorialRecursive(n - 1);
}

IMPORTANT: 
1. Iterative is preferred because recursion uses extra memory (stack calls).
2. However, recursion is useful for problems like backtracking and divide & conquer.
