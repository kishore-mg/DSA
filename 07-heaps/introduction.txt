Heaps is a binary tree where
 - It will always be a complete tree.

Complete Tree - Fills from left to right without any gaps.

       50
     /    \
    30    40
   /  \   / 
  10   5 20

Not a complete tree as it contains a gap
       50
     /    \
    30    40
   /      / 
  10     20


Max Heap
- The top node will be max/greatest one when compared with their decendants.
Example
        50
       /  \
     30    40
    / \   / 
   10  5 20

Min Heap
- The top node will be minimum when compared with their decendants.
Example
        5
       / \
     10  20
    / \  /
   30 40 50

The heap can be represented in ArrayList instead of Node class.

leftChild = 2 * parentIndex
rightChild = 2 * parentIndex + 1
