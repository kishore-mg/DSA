A graph consist of vertices and edges.

A - B
|
C - D

A -> Vertex or Node
- | -> Edge or Connection


Edges can be weighted 
 - Used in google maps to choose the best route
 - Network routing where taking a extra hop can be reduce latency

Edges can be 
 - Weighted
 - Non weighted
 - Directional
 - Bi-Directional

LinkedList is a form of tree and tree is a form of graph.

Need more understanding on adjacency matrix

Graph can be represented in two ways
1. Adjacency matrix
2. Adjacency list - HashMap

Time Complexity:
Add Vertex
 - O(V^2) - AM
 - O(1)   - AL

Add Edge
 - O(1) - AM
 - O(1) - AL

Remove Edge
 - O(1) - AM
 - O(E) - AL

Remove Vertex
 - O(V^2) - AM
 - O(V + E) - AL

V - no of vertices
E - no of edges

One of the greatest advantage with AL compared to AM is that
The AM stores zero value for billions of parameters or columns 
in the matrix which is not space efficient.
